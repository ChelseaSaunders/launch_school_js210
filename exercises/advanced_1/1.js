// Let's build another program using madlibs. We made a similar program in the
// Easy exercises, but this time the requirements are a bit different.

// Build a madlibs program that takes a text template as input, plugs in a
// selection of randomized nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs into that text,
// and then returns it. You can build your lists of nouns, verbs, adjectives,
// and adverbs directly into your program. Your program should read this text
// and, for each line, place random words of the appropriate types into the text
// and return the result.

// The challenge of this program isn't just about writing your solutionâ€”it's
// about choosing the structure of the text template. Choose the right way to
// structure your template and this problem becomes much easier. Consequently,
// this exercise is a bit more open-ended since the input is also something that
// you'll be defining.

// Examples:

// Note: The quotes in the example strings returned by the madlibs function are
// only shown for emphasis. These quotes are not present in the actual output
// strings. The words in quotes come from the list of texts and it is the
// madlibs function that puts them in.

// These examples use the following list of replacement texts:
const adjectives = ['quick', 'lazy', 'sleepy', 'noisy', 'hungry'];
const nouns =  ['fox', 'dog', 'head', 'leg', 'tail', 'cat'];
const verbs = ['jumps', 'lifts', 'bites', 'licks', 'pats'];
const adverbs = ['easily', 'lazily', 'noisily', 'excitedly'];

let template1 = `The "adjective" brown "noun" "adjective" "verb" the `+
                `"adjective" "noun", who "adverb" "verb" his "noun" and `+
                `looks around.`

let template2 = `The "noun" "verb" the "noun"'s "noun".`

function madlibs(template) {
  template = replaceWords(template, 'noun', nouns);
  template = replaceWords(template, 'adjective', adjectives);
  template = replaceWords(template, 'adverb', adverbs);
  template = replaceWords(template, 'verb', verbs);

  return template;
}

function replaceWords(madlibTemplate, wordType, wordTypeArray) {
  let regEx = new RegExp(wordType, 'i');
  while (madlibTemplate.match(regEx) !== null) {
    let randomWord = randomElement(wordTypeArray);
    madlibTemplate = madlibTemplate.replace(regEx, randomWord);
  }
  return madlibTemplate;
}
function randomElement(array) {
  let randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length);
  return array[randomIndex];
}

console.log(madlibs(template1));
// The "sleepy" brown "cat" "noisily"
// "licks" the "sleepy" yellow
// "dog", who "lazily" "licks" his
// "tail" and looks around.

console.log(madlibs(template1));
// The "hungry" brown "cat" "lazily"
// "licks" the "noisy" yellow
// "dog", who "lazily" "licks" his
// "leg" and looks around.

console.log(madlibs(template2));      // The "fox" "bites" the "dog"'s "tail".
console.log(madlibs(template2));      // The "cat" "pats" the "cat"'s "head".
